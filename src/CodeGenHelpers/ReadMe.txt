Thanks for downloading the AvantiPoint CodeGenHelpers. This helper library will help you more easily write Source Generators with a pattern that allows you to pass in strings, some System Type's or Roslyn Type Symbols. The generated code can be added to the builder in any order and will output a nicely formatted source file.

The CodeGenHelpers come in two flavors, set using `CodeGenHelpersMode`:
- `Assembly`, in order to be used as a normal assembly
- `Source`, where the helpers are linked as source files to eliminate issues with assembly references.
